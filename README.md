# Plant-Monitor
Written in C++, using a Nucleoboard and I/O devices, this gadget is used to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light level in household plants. The program starts in a real-time loop, and prints the data read from each individually calibrated sensor. All sensor data is then sent to the plantStatus function and used in an if-statement block to check whether the environmentâ€™s attributes are within the appropriate thresholds. A red or green LED light will then illuminate to indicate whether the plant needs maintenance.
