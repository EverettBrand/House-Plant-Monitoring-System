# Plant-Monitor
Written in C++, using a Nucleoboard and I/O devices, this program is used to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light level in household plants. LEDs illuminate to indicate whether the environmentâ€™s attributes are within the appropriate thresholds. This will notify the owner that the plant needs maintenance.
